        <p><strong>easybook</strong> allows you to publish the very same book in radically different 
ways. This is possible thanks to the <strong>editions</strong>, that define the specific 
characteristics of the published book.</p>

<p>Editions are defined under the <code>editions</code> option in the <code>config.yml</code> file. By
default, the books created with the <code>new</code> command define five editions named
<code>ebook</code>, <code>kindle</code>, <code>print</code>, <code>web</code> and <code>website</code>:</p>

<p>~~~ .yaml
book:
    # ...
    editions:
        ebook:
            format:  epub
            # ...</p>

<pre><code>    kindle:
        extends: ebook
        format:  mobi

    print:
        format:  pdf
        # ...

    web:
        format:  html
        # ...

    website:
        extends: web
        format:  html_chunked
</code></pre>

<p>~~~</p>

<h2 id="edition-formats">3.1. Edition formats</h2>

<p>A single book can define as many editions as needed. The only requirement is
that the name of each edition must be unique for the same book and cannot contain white spaces.</p>

<p>Each edition is published at the <code>Output/</code> directory of the book, in a
subdirectory named after the edition name. You can define any number of 
editions, but all of them must belong to one of the following five types 
defined by the <code>format</code> option:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>epub</code>, the book is published as an e-book named <code>book.epub</code>.</li>
<li><code>mobi</code>, the book is published as a Kindle-compatible e-book named
<code>book.mobi</code>.</li>
<li><code>pdf</code>, the book is published as a PDF file named <code>book.pdf</code>.</li>
<li><code>html</code>, the book is published as a HTML page named <code>book.html</code>.</li>
<li><code>html_chunked</code>, the book is published as a static website in a directory
named <code>book/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration-options">3.2. Configuration options</h2>

<p>The purpose of the editions is to define a set of unique characteristics for 
the published book. This is done with the several configuration options defined
by <strong>easybook</strong> for the editions. Some of these options are common for every
edition format and others are specific to each format.</p>

<h3 id="common-edition-options">3.2.1. Common configuration options</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>highlight_code</code>, this option is only useful for technical books that 
include code listings. If <code>true</code>, the syntax of the code is highlighted.</li>
<li><code>highlight_cache</code>, this option is only useful for technical books that 
include source code. If <code>true</code>, all the highlighted code listings will be 
cached to boost book publishing performance. By default this cache is 
disabled because it's only appropriate for complex books that are 
generated regularly.</li>
<li><code>include_styles</code>, if <code>true</code> <strong>easybook</strong> default CSS styles are applied to
the published book. If you want to fully customize the design of your 
book, don't apply these styles. However, most of the time it's better to
apply thee default styles and tweak the design with the <code>customize</code> 
command.</li>
<li><code>labels</code>, sets the content types for which <strong>easybook</strong> will add labels
to their section headings. By default labels are only added to headings of
chapters and appendices. In addition to the regular content types, you can
use two special values called <code>figure</code> and <code>table</code> to add labels for book
images and tables. If you don't want to show labels in your book, set an
empty value for this option: <code>labels: ~</code>.</li>
<li><code>toc</code>, sets the options of the table of contents. It's ignored unless the
book has at least one <code>toc</code> element type. It has two options:

<ul>
<li><code>deep</code>, the maximum heading level included in the TOC (<code>1</code> is the lowest
possible number and would only show <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> level headings; <code>6</code> is the
highest possible value and would show all <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;h5&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> headings).</li>
<li><code>elements</code>, the type of elements included in the TOC (by default, only
<code>appendix</code>, <code>chapter</code> and <code>part</code> are included).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="format-specific-configuration-options">3.2.2. Format specific configuration options</h3>

<p>In addition to the common configuration options, some formats define their own
specific configuration options:</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="internal" href="./chapter-5.html#html-configuration-options">Configuration options for the <code>html_chunked</code> format</a></li>
<li><a class="internal" href="./chapter-8.html#pdf-configuration-options">Configuration options for the <code>pdf</code> format</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="before-and-after-scripts">3.3. Before and after scripts</h2>

<p>Publishing a digital book usually involves more than the actual publication
of the book. Sometimes, before publishing the book, its contents must be
updated by downloading them from a remote server. After the publication, you
may need to copy the book into another directory or you may have to notify 
some other system about the publication.</p>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> simplifies all these tasks with the <code>before_publish</code> and
<code>after_publish</code> edition options. These options are modeled after the popular
<a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#before_script%2C-after_script"><code>before_script</code> and <code>after_script</code> Travis CI options</a> and allow you to
execute commands before or after the book publication without the need to
define a custom plugin or a script.</p>

<p>Each option admit an array of commands that are executed sequentially:</p>

<p>~~~ .yaml
book:
    title: '...'
    # ...</p>

<pre><code>editions:
    # ...

    website:
        format:      html_chunked
        chunk_level: 2
        # ...

        before_publish:
            - echo "This command is executed before book publishing"
            - git pull ...
            - cp ...

        after_publish:
            - "/home/user/scripts/notify_book_publish.sh"
            - "/home/user/scripts/update_google_sitemap_xml.sh"
</code></pre>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>If you only need to execute one command, you can replace the array for
a simple string:</p>

<p>~~~ .yaml
book:
    # ...</p>

<pre><code>editions:

    website:
        # ...
        before_publish: "cd ... &amp;&amp; git pull"
        after_publish:  "/home/user/scripts/notify_book_publish.sh"
</code></pre>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>As any other <strong>easybook</strong> command, all of these scripts are rendered as Twig
strings, so they can easily access to any application property:</p>

<p>~~~ .yaml
book:
    # ...</p>

<pre><code>editions:

    website:
        # ...
        before_publish: "git clone git://github.com/{{ app.get('publishing.book.slug') }}/book"
        after_publish:  "cp ... /home/{{ book.author }}/books/{{ 'now'|date('YmdHis') }}_book.pdf"
</code></pre>

<p>~~~</p>

<h2 id="extending-editions">3.4. Extending editions</h2>

<p>In addition to the previous configuration options, editions can also set a 
very useful option named <code>extends</code>. The value of this option is interpreted as
the name of the edition from which this edition <em>inherits</em>. When an edition
<em>inherits</em> from another edition, the options of the parent edition are copied 
on the <em>heir</em> edition, which can then override any value.</p>

<p>Imagine for example that you want to publish one PDF book with three slightly
different designs. The draft version (<code>draft</code>) must be double-sided and must
have very small margins to reduce its length, the normal version (<code>print</code>) is
one-sided and has normal margins. The version prepared for lulu.com website
(<code>lulu.com</code>) is similar to the normal version, except is double-sided:</p>

<p>~~~ .yaml
book:
    # ...
    editions:
        print:
            format:       pdf
            margin:
                top:      25mm
                bottom:   25mm
                inner:    30mm
                outter:   20mm
            page_size:    A4
            two_sided:    false</p>

<pre><code>    draft:
        extends:      print
        margin:
            top:      15mm
            bottom:   15mm
            inner:    20mm
            outter:   10mm
        two_sided:    true

    lulu.com:
        extends:      print
        two_sided:    true
</code></pre>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>First, define a new <code>pdf</code> format edition called <code>print</code> and set the page size, 
the margins and disable the two-sided printing. Then, instead of creating a new
edition for the <code>draft</code> book, you inherit from the previous edition
(<code>extends: print</code>) and override its margins and the <code>two_sided</code> option.</p>

<p>Similarly, as the <code>lulu.com</code> version is almost the same as the <code>print</code> edition,
instead of creating a new edition, you just inherit from it (<code>extends: print</code>) 
and then you override the only different configuration option.</p>

<p>The only limitation of <code>extends</code> is that it only works with one level of 
inheritance. Therefore, and edition cannot extend another edition that extends 
a third one.</p>

<p>If several editions share a large set of configuration options, you can 
group them under a common <em>fake</em> edition and make the other <em>real</em> editions
extend from it.</p>

<p>If for example your <code>before_publish</code> and <code>after_publish</code> scripts are the
same for every edition, group them in a <em>fake</em> edition:</p>

<p>~~~ .yaml
book:
    # ...
    editions:
        common:
            before_publish: ...
            after_publish:  ...</p>

<pre><code>     edition1:
        extends: common
        # ...

     edition2:
        extends: common
        # ...

     edition3:
        extends: common
        # ...
</code></pre>

<p>~~~</p>
