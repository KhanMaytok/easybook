        <p><strong>easybook</strong> is an application that lets you easily publish books in various
electronic formats. Although it was originally designed to publish programming 
books, you can use <strong>easyboook</strong> to publish any kind of book, manual or 
documentation website.</p>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> is currently designed for authors with advanced computer skills 
or companies with IT departments or personnel. For that reason, <strong>easybook</strong> 
lacks a GUI interface and it can only be used from the command line.</p>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> is also a free and open-source application published under the
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>. This means that you can do <em>almost</em> anything with it. The 
only condition is that if you use <strong>easybook</strong> in your applications, you must 
always maintain the original <code>LICENSE.md</code> file included in the source code of 
<strong>easybook</strong>. This file explains the license of the application and its 
original author.</p>

<h2 id="installing-easybook">1.1. Installing easybook</h2>

<p>Before installing <strong>easybook</strong>, make sure that you have PHP 5.3.2 or higher 
installed on your computer. This is the only technical requisite to install 
and use <strong>easybook</strong>. You can check your installed PHP version executing the 
following command on the console:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ php -v
~~~</p>

<p>The recommended method to install <strong>easybook</strong> is to use <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ php composer.phar create-project easybook/easybook <installation-dir>
~~~</p>

<p>Replace the <code>&lt;installation-dir&gt;</code> with the path where you want <strong>easybook</strong>
to be installed and you are done. If Composer isn't installed on your computer,
you can install it executing the following command:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
~~~</p>

<p>Once installed, check that everything is correct by executing the <code>./book</code>
script inside the <strong>easybook</strong> installation directory. If you see the list of
available commands, everything went fine:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ cd <easybook-installation-dir>
$ ./book</p>

<pre><code>                 |              |
</code></pre>

<p>,---.,---.,---.,   .|---.,---.,---.|__/
 |---',---|<code>---.|   ||   ||   ||   ||  \</code>---'<code>---^</code>---'<code>---|</code>---'<code>---'</code>---'<code></code>
                `---'</p>

<p>easybook is the easiest and fastest tool to generate
technical documentation, books, manuals and websites.</p>

<p>Available commands:
  benchmark   Benchmarks the performance of book publishing
  customize   Eases the customization of the book design
  help        Displays help for a command
  list        Lists commands
  new         Creates a new empty book
  publish     Publishes an edition of a book
  version     Shows installed easybook version
~~~</p>

<div class="admonition note">
  <p>If the <code>./book</code> script doesn't work, try <code>php book</code> or check the execution
  permissions of the <code>book</code> script.</p>
</div>

<p>The <code>./book</code> script is the unique <em>entry point</em> for every <strong>easybook</strong>
command. If you need to know for example the installed version, just run the
<code>version</code> command through the <code>book</code> script:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ ./book version</p>

<pre><code>                |              |    
</code></pre>

<p>,---.,---.,---.,   .|---.,---.,---.|__/ 
|---',---|<code>---.|   ||   ||   ||   ||  \</code>---'<code>---^</code>---'<code>---|</code>---'<code>---'</code>---'<code></code>
               `---'</p>

<p>easybook installed version: 5.0
~~~</p>

<h3 id="alternative-installation-methods">1.1.1. Alternative installation methods</h3>

<p>If you just want to test drive <strong>easybook</strong>, download the <a href="https://github.com/javiereguiluz/easybook-package/blob/master/easybook.zip?raw=true">easybook.zip</a> 
file, uncompress it somewhere and you are done.</p>

<p>If you are an advanced user that want to <em>hack</em> or modify <strong>easybook</strong>, clone its repository with Git and install its dependencies with Composer:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ mkdir easybook
$ git clone http://github.com/javiereguiluz/easybook.git easybook</p>

<p>// download vendors and dependencies
$ cd easybook
$ php composer.phar install
~~~</p>

<h2 id="publishing-the-first-book">1.2. Publishing the first book</h2>

<p>Before creating your first book in <a class="internal" href="./chapter-1.html#creating-a-new-book">the next section</a>, 
let's dig into book publication using the <strong>easybook</strong> documentation as the 
sample book. This book is located at the <code>doc/easybook-doc-en/</code> directory and 
it's a good resource for learning how to create advanced books with
<strong>easybook</strong>.</p>

<p>In order to transform the original Markdown contents of the documentation into
a real book, execute the following command:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ cd <installation-dir>
$ ./book publish easybook-doc-en web
~~~</p>

<p>The first argument of the <code>publish</code> command is the name of the directory where
the book contents are stored (<code>easybook-doc-en</code>) and the second argument is the
name of the <code>edition</code> to be published. After executing this command, you 
should see the following output:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ ./book publish easybook-doc-en web</p>

<pre><code>                 |              |
</code></pre>

<p>,---.,---.,---.,   .|---.,---.,---.|__/
 |---',---|<code>---.|   ||   ||   ||   ||  \</code>---'<code>---^</code>---'<code>---|</code>---'<code>---'</code>---'<code></code>
                `---'</p>

<p>Publishing 'web' edition of 'easybook documentation' book...</p>

<p>[ OK ]  You can access the book in the following directory:
 <installation-dir>/doc/easybook-doc-en/Output/web</p>

<p>The publishing process took 0.5 seconds
~~~</p>

<p>The <code>publish</code> command always displays the edition (<code>web</code>) and the title
(<code>easybook documentation</code>) of the book being published. Editions are one of the
most powerful <strong>easybook</strong> features and they are thoroughly explained in
<a class="internal" href="./chapter-3.html#editions">their own chapter</a>. For now, consider that a single book can be 
published in a lot of different ways and formats, each of one being an 
edition.</p>

<p>In case of error, the output of the <code>publish</code> command also displays the error
cause and most of the times,how to solve it. If everything went fine, the
<code>publish</code> command displays the path of the directory where that book edition
was published (<code>&lt;installation-dir&gt;/doc/easybook-doc-en/Output/web</code>) and the
total time elapsed to publish the book (<code>0.5 seconds</code>).</p>

<p>Browse to the <code>&lt;installation-dir&gt;/doc/easybook-doc-en/Output/web</code> directory and
you'll find an HTML file called <code>book.html</code>. If you open it with a browser,
you'll see the full <strong>easybook</strong> documentation published as a single HTML page.</p>

<p>Books published as single HTML pages aren't very useful, so execute now the
following command to publish the book as a website:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ ./book publish easybook-doc-en website
~~~</p>

<p>If you browse to the <code>&lt;installation-dir&gt;/doc/easybook-doc-en/Output/website</code> 
directory, you'll find a directory called <code>book/</code> with a lot of HTML files 
inside it. As you can see, just by publishing another edition (<code>website</code>
instead of <code>web</code>) the same book is published in a totally different way.</p>

<p>Execute once again the <code>publish</code> command but using the <code>ebook</code> edition:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ ./book publish easybook-doc-en ebook
~~~</p>

<p>As you surely have guessed, the book is now published as a <code>book.epub</code> file
inside the <code>&lt;installation-dir&gt;/doc/easybook-doc-en/Output/ebook</code> directory. Now
you can copy this <code>book.epub</code> file into any <code>.ePub</code> compatible reader (iPad 
tablets, iPhone phones, most Android tablets and phones and every e-book 
reader except Amazon Kindle) and start reading the <strong>easybook</strong> documentation 
as an e-book.</p>

<p>Similarly, you can publish your book as <code>MOBI</code> (the format for Kindle-
compatible e-books) and <code>PDF</code> files. However, these formats require the 
installation of two libraries and they will be explained in the next chapters:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
// publishes the book as a PDF file
$ ./book publish easybook-doc-en print</p>

<p>// publishes the book as a Kindle-compatible MOBI e-book
$ ./book publish easybook-doc-en kindle
~~~</p>

<div class="admonition note">
  <p>For those impatient readers that cannot wait to try the <code>MOBI</code> and <code>PDF</code>
  publication, these are the third-party libraries needed to generate those
  formats:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>For <code>MOBI</code> books: <a href="http://amzn.to/kindlegen">KindleGen</a></li>
  <li>For <code>PDF</code> books: <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-book">1.3. Creating a new book</h2>

<p>In this section you will create and publish your own book. <strong>easybook</strong> 
requires that your books follow a certain structure of files and directories. 
To avoid creating this structure by hand, books are bootstrapped with the <code>new</code>
command:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ ./book new "My First Book"
~~~</p>

<p>The only argument required by the <code>new</code> command is the title of the book 
enclosed with quotes. After executing the previous command, <strong>easybook</strong> will 
create a new directory called <code>my-first-book</code> inside the <strong>easybook</strong> <code>doc/</code> 
directory, and with the following file and directory structure:</p>

<p>~~~
<easybook>/
    doc/
        my-first-book/
            config.yml
            Contents/
                chapter1.md
                chapter2.md
                images/
            Output/
~~~</p>

<p>These are the files and directories created by <strong>easybook</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>config.yml</code>, this file contains all the book configuration options.
We'll cover all of them in the next chapters, but meanwhile you can change 
the <code>author</code> option to set your name as the book author's name.</li>
<li><code>Contents/</code>, this directory stores all the book contents (both text and
images). <strong>easybook</strong> creates two sample chapters (<code>chapter1.md</code> and
<code>chapter2.md</code>) and an empty <code>images/</code> directory.</li>
<li><code>Output/</code>, initially this directory is empty, but eventually it will 
contain the published book.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="writing-the-book">1.3.1. Writing the book</h3>

<p>Book contents are written using regular text files with the Markdown syntax.
This format has become the <em>de facto</em> standard for writing documentation for
Internet. If you are not familiar with the Markdown syntax, read the
<a class="internal" href="#markdown-reference">Markdown reference</a> appendix.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
  <p>Markdown is the only format currently supported by <strong>easybook</strong>. In the
  future, more formats will be supported, such as reStructuredText and
  Textile.</p>
</div>

<p>Therefore, forget <strong>easybook</strong> for a while and write the contents of your
book in Markdown syntax using your favorite text editor (<code>vi</code>, <em>Notepad</em>,
<em>TextMate</em>, <em>SublimeText</em>, etc.)</p>

<p>The <code>config.yml</code> file lists all the book items, such as the chapters and 
appendices. The sample book created with the <code>new</code> command only includes two
chapters. Therefore, whenever you add a new chapter to the book, don't forget 
to add it to the <code>config.yml</code> file too:</p>

<p>~~~ .yaml
book:
    # ...
    contents:
        - { element: cover }
        - { element: toc   }
        - { element: chapter, number: 1, content: chapter1.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 2, content: chapter2.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 3, content: chapter3.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 4, content: chapter4.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 5, content: chapter5.md }
        - ...
~~~</p>

<p>The next chapter explains in detail all the configuration options of this file,
and the 21 different <a class="internal" href="./chapter-2.html#content-types">content types</a> that <strong>easybook</strong> books
can include.</p>

<p>As the book publication process is extremely fast (less than 2 seconds for a
400-page book on an average computer), you can publish every edition of the
book periodically to check your progress:</p>

<p>~~~ .cli
$ ./book publish my-first-book web
$ ./book publish my-first-book website
$ ./book publish my-first-book ebook
$ ./book publish my-first-book kindle
$ ./book publish my-first-book print
~~~</p>
